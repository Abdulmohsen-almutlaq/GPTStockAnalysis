## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdulmohsen-almutlaq/GPTStockAnalysis.git
    cd GPTStockAnalysis
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install System Dependencies**

    Create a `packages.txt` file in the root directory with the following content:

    ```plaintext
    chromium
    chromium-driver
    ```

    This ensures that Chromium and its driver are installed, which are necessary for Selenium.

    **Note:** If you're deploying to **Streamlit Cloud**, ensure that this `packages.txt` file is included in your repository root. Streamlit Cloud will automatically install the specified system packages during deployment.

## üîí Configuration

### 1. OpenAI API Key

The app requires an OpenAI API key to generate GPT-powered insights. You can provide this key in two ways:

#### a. Using Streamlit Secrets

1. **Locally:** Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the root directory:

    ```toml
    API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

2. **On Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Navigate to your app on Streamlit Cloud.
   - Go to the **"Settings"** tab.
   - Click on **"Secrets"** and add your `API_KEY` there.

#### b. User Input

If the API key isn't found in `secrets.toml`, users can manually enter their API key in the sidebar.

### 2. Exchange Data

Ensure that the `exchange_info.json` file is present in the root directory. This file contains necessary exchange information for stock symbols.

## üí° Usage

1. **Run the App**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Interact with the App**

    - **Enter Stock Symbol:** Input the ticker symbol of the stock you wish to analyze (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).
    - **Select Timeframe:** Choose the desired timeframe for your analysis.
    - **Choose Prompt Type:** Select the type of analysis prompt for GPT.
    - **Analyze:** Click the "üöÄ Analyze" button to generate the chart and receive GPT-powered insights.
